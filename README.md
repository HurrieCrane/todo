# Todo List 

* Create a -m flag (mass edit) pass in numbers seperated by commas
e.g 1,5,66,3...  you can then change their tag, pri, and list in a mass edit but NOT the title
* Edit a single title gives you it in editor
* Add notes to each todo that can be displayed or not
* Handle a syncing function to get todo lists anywhere! - use git?
